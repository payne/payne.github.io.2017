## General Links about Money
1. http://www.daveramsey.com/fpu/ is a wonderful place for people to start.  But don't stop there.
2. http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/ is a great answer to how much to save.  Much better than Fidelity's 10x rule of thumb.

1. The [rule of thumb called 10x](http://media.fidelity.com/assets/NetBenefits_VMS/995/267/Milestone_Video_Transcript.pdf)
   1. By the time you're 30, try to save the equivalent of your annual salary at that age.
   1. At 34, aim for twice the amount of whatever your salary is at that age.
   1. At 40, 3x your salary at that age.
   1. At 50, 6x your salary at that age.
   1. At 60, 8x your salary at that age.
   1. At 67, your savings should be 10x of your salary at 67.
