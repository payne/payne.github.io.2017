## Basics

* I am a computer programmer living in Omaha, NE.
* My name is Matt Payne.
* I try to be nice.  Boundaries are an important component of being nice.
* There are, at least, three people named Matt Payne in Omaha, NE.
* AFAIK I am the only Matt Payne, in Omaha, who is a computer programmer.

## Very kind background story
* Many thanks to [Agape Red](http://AgapeRed.com) for a [nice writeup about me](http://blog.agapered.com/matt-payne-is-awesome/)
