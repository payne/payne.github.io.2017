I am not sure I'm interested in the work associated with ledger (or some other http://PlainTextAccounting.org/ system).

I'm intrigued by the plain text data format and the theoretical possibility of an accounting system where many people can build tools for the data rather than just waiting for a new feature to be released by YNAB/MoneyWell/Quicken.

https://github.com/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab is an example of not YNAB innovating on the YNAB platform.

It would be AMAZING if accounting software exported to ledger format directly rather than just CSV. There are lots of CSV to ledger format tools. I've not tried many, yet.

Currently, I'm thinking about the pipe dream of YNAB as primary and then monthly/weekly exports of the data to CSV. Running that CSV through some programs to build a ledger journal. Then when Tracey comments that YNAB search isn't that good, we can use our journal data files. When YNAB fails to make it easy to answer a question, maybe we can get the answer from a PlainTextAccounting.org program. Or, gasp, write one to answer the question?

One of the many, many things I love about YNAB is their policy: it's your data.

The other day we were changing a bunch of things in YNAB, and I wished we had checked things into git and could do a `git reset --hard` if needed.

Peter Keen's work is exciting.

I'm optimistic I'll find other exciting work in the PlainTextAccounting.org community.

http://sachachua.com/…/2…/11/keeping-financial-score-ledger/ is another interesting post I found this morning. She points out that this is part of the "quantified self" world. http://sachachua.com/category/quantified/ I'm glad Sacha did that because it wasn't obvious to me.

Do you agree that one of the benefits of budgeting is increasing mindfulness? Awareness that how your spend money is a reflection of your priorities? I realize that for many people it's not a good reflection of their priorities.


I love the YNAB community! The blogs, podcasts, weekly whiteboard sessions, tutorials, and the people. The other day someone started a average expenditure database at https://goo.gl/yDvh4A I think that is very useful and interesting!

What online budget communities do you like? What budget blogs do you like? What do you like about them?
