Start with [Ruby on Rails with Cloud9](http://railsapps.github.io/rubyonrails-cloud9.html) by Daniel Kehoe (5/28/2016)

Also look at the note from the OCW meeting.  These are in the c9 workspace: https://ide.c9.io/payne/ocw-announcements-try2 the NOTES.md file.

Need to test getting things working on c9 and then deploying to heroku.com and/or AWS.
